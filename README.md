# Domino
How to Play: Click dominos to select them. Right click a domino or select a domino and hit the space bar to flip the domino. To play the domino on the right side of the board, press the "D" key. To play the domino on the left side of the board, press the "A" key.

Known Bugs:
  1. After clicking to draw from boneyard, the button stays selected and keys become unresponsive. To get around this, press any arrow key after clicking the boneyard button. 
  2. After someone wins, dominos can still be played.
